            This is an example of an experimental project, to create new patterns and explore worlds and textures, which can be integrated into other work.

            I studied the Influence of various everyday chemicals such as acetone and hydrogen peroxide on leather, to see what damage they cause and might inflict on human skin.

            I also used acrylic, coffee, colors from nature like red berries and spinach, next to Wax, and other things that ended up in my hands, in search of a medium that is particularly suitable for leather.

            These are the results of the microscopic photos I took.
