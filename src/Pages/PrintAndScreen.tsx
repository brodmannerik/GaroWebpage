            When designing posters, I like to mix analog with digital.
            I find it exciting. 

            Though nowadays I‘m working more digitally, I still like the handwork on the digital. This led me to create the „No dream is too high!“ poster that literally does that, thus making it an interactive poster while allowing interactors to take their work home
